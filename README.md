# Doge Bot
A fun chat bot made for Discord by me. Includes custom made currency, fun commands, and admin commands.

# How to setup:
1. Download the required files to make the bot work.
2. In 'bot.py', go to the variable token and change it to the token of your own server.
3. (optional:) go to the 'admin commands' section, and change the required permissions for access to each command.
4. Host the project on a desired server/computer and run 'bot.py'.
